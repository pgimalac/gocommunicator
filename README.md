# GoCommunicator
Decentralized Systems Engineering (master course at EPFL) project.

The goal of this project was to write a decentralized communication and file sharing software.

It uses algorithms such as heartbeat, anti-entropy, BubbleStorm and BubbleCast, Blockchain and Paxos (to reach consensus on the names of the files and store them).

For more details on how the software was built, how it works, what its precise goals were, etc, check the `HomeworkX.pdf` files.
